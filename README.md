I decided to automate the process. I wrote a linux script. It will ask the user for the office file name and which word list you want to use. It will then pass the details to office2john and output the results to a file, then input this with outer variables into the john application. The cracking process will then start automatically . 

for the sript to work one must change the right on offcie2john2john.sh 
chmod 744 offcie2john2john.sh
run by calling the script ./offcie2john2john.sh
